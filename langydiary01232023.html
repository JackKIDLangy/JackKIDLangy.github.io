  <h1>2023年1月23日の日記 Diary of January 23th, 2023</h1>

  <p>
    <h3>
        My job-hunting activity is showing signs of success on the first day.
    </h3>
    I have been working as a security guard for about 3 years now. 
    At first, I felt a sense of satisfaction from being part of society 
    and contributing to it through my work, but as time went on, 
    I gradually came to understand that there was nothing productive about this job. 
    The only positive aspect was that the salary was high, 
    and I could use that money for my own interests and activities. But other than that, 
    I started to question if I could continue doing this job. Those were the days.
    Recently I have obtained a qualification that is not a national one, called "列車見張員" in Japanese. 
    It is limited to JR East Japan, but with this qualification, 
    I can be in charge of understanding when trains are coming, 
    for example, when construction work related to stations and tracks is taking place. 
    Before the train reaches the area where we are working, 
    I can inform the workers and the supervisor on site, and take them to safety. 
    It's a heavy responsibility to protect their safety. 
    I don't know if such a job exists in the same or different form abroad, but it exists in Japan.
    However, after obtaining that qualification for several weeks, 
    I haven't done any such work yet. I am still just a traffic guidance security guard, 
    and it's a very boring life. That's what made me decide to change jobs. 
    The people who read this diary probably don't understand, 
    as most of them have never actually done this kind of work. 
    Moreover, this diary is written in English, 
    so it's even more likely that it will be read by people in English-speaking countries 
    or those who can speak English to some degree. 
    Even so, what I want to do first is to get away from this kind of life where I am just a security guard. I am already tired of it.

    <h3>
        The day I realized that just putting out information 
        for people to see has value and that it's something that should be done.
    </h3>
    I, Kenta Yokota, have been creating my own web page and learning about data structures and algorithms in C, 
    and writing incredibly long self-introduction texts in both Japanese and English, 
    and reporting all of the results to everyone on Twitter and my own web page. 
    And when I tried linking these results to job search sites and applying to various companies, 
    one company in particular recognized my achievements. 
    Specifically, they sent me a message saying, 
    'We've seen your registered background and we would like to have a conversation with you.' 
    What a great thing this is! 
    My activities, based on my beliefs and convictions, have led to good evaluations. 
    And not only that, but it's a job that involves working with C and C++. 
    I was convinced on this day that I was not wrong. So, on January 25th, 2023, 
    I took a break from work in the afternoon and had an interview. 
    I will do my best to express everything I've done so far and try to be hired. 
      Well, see you again sometime.

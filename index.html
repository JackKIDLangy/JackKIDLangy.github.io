      <h2>Self-introduction</h2><br>
      A human being who teaches English to people as a tutor and engages in learning from multiple perspectives to explore the truth that may exist in this world<br>
      I am 22 years old and an undergraduate student at The Open University of Japan. I love learning regardless of whether it is in the humanities or sciences. Additionally, I have hired a wide range of people from university undergraduates to working professionals as my home tutors,and I have learned programming (data structures and algorithms), mathematics, logic, physics, chemistry, and linguistics from them. As for my future plans, I have decided to attend graduate school at The Open University of Japan and take the Japanese judicial examination (and preparatory exam). Therefore, while I work every day, I am also studying hard to prepare for it.
